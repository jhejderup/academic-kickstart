# Hoi!

ðŸš¨ _Page under construction_ ðŸš¨

Welcome to my academic space!

I am a PhD Student at the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/), TU Delft under the supervision of my incredible advisor, [dr. Georgios Gousios](http://gousios.org/).

My research mission is to develop new techniques for making package management systems (such as [Cargo](https://crates.io/)/[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)) more intelligent, safe and robust. As a step towards this ambitious goal, I was among the very first who explored the idea of deriving a versioned dependency network of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for security tracking. As a result, my [MSc thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:3a15293b-16f6-4e9d-b6a2-f02cd52f1a9e) sparked discussions about dependency issues on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10027356). In my PhD, I am combining my interest for program analysis with dependency networks to enable ecosystem-wide data-driven program analysis.
